Dynamic schema with validation
--

### Points of interest

1. **db/dynamic_schema/main.clj**  
   Entry point to create scheme and finally logs validation-result
2. **db/dynamic_schema/schema_definitions.clj**   
   Contains configuration to create validation-scheme used to validate requests/responses
3. **web.clj::coercion-error-debug-log**   
   Debug-Log that contains helpful information if response throws exception

### Challenges concerning schema-creation by db
1. Not every db-column-type is correct, or you want to replace it by a specific one (enum, order, pagination)
2. Schema-definition with optional/required/maybe/either in different variations required
3. Merged schema-definition with multiple db-tables or/and additional colum-definitions required
4. Definition of top-level-schema needed (search for 'top-level')
5. Override specific db-column type
6. (+) Configuration can be moved into database if needed
7. (+) Validation of config & get-schema-results (should not be s/Any)
8. (+) Additional helpful error-log-entry if coercion fails


### TODO:
1. rename TYPE_NOTHING to TYPE_REQUIRED

---

Goal: create schema by db and additional config

### :raw-features
- renaming
- black-list / white-list
- add additional definitions
```clojure
;; raw-schema example: (no additional types like maybe/optional/required/..)
;; format: {<name> <type>}
;; features: renaming, black-list, white-list, add additional definitions
;; THIS WILL BE GENERATED BY RAW-SECTION
{:id s/Uuid
 :meta_datum_id s/Uuid
 :person_id s/Uuid
 :role_id (s/maybe s/Uuid)
 :position s/Int
 }


;; raw-schema example: (no additional types like maybe/optional/required/..)
;; format: {<key-type <name>> <value-type <type>>}
;; features: black-list, white-list
;; THIS WILL BE GENERATED BY SCHEMAS-SECTION
{
 :meta_datum_id s/Int
 (s/required :person_id) (s/maybe s/Str)
 (s/required articles) (s/maybe [s/Str])

 (s/optional :role_id) (s/->Either s/Uuid)
 (s/optional :name) vector-or-hashmap-validation         ;; customized validation
}

```

### Workflow
> **Prepare raw-schema** requires `:raw & :raw-schema-name` attributes. Its purpose is to create & cache schema.   
> It acts as base-configuration for `:schemas` - in this section you add 
> - key-section-attributes (required/optional)
> - value-section-attributes (maybe)


1. **Create raw-schema** `create-dynamic-schema`
   1. Fetch enum-definitions from db and put it into **enum-cache** `init-enums-by-db`
   2. Fetch table-meta from db`create-raw-schema`
      1. TODO: .. if not yet exists in schema
   2. Modify schema-types & namings `revise-schema-types`
      1. Rename table-names if needed
      2. Validate configuration by renaming/bl/wl-attributes
      3. Process black/white-listing
      4. Add additional fields (pagination, order, ..)
      5. Override type-mapping by type OR <table.column> `type-mapping & type-mapping-enums`
      6. Use **schema-cache** for caching
2. **Schemas-section** uses cached **raw-schema** to add section-attributes (maybe/optional/required)
   1. Validate configuration by renaming/bl/wl-attributes
   2. Process black/white-listing
3. Log validation summery (**validation-cache**)
   1. Are bl/wl/renaming configs correct and all db-attributes are available as well? Otherwise error-entry
   2. Does every (get-schema <name>) return a config - not s/Any? Otherwise error-entry



### Helpful methods
1. get-schema / set-schema
2. get-enum / set-enum
3. get-validation-cache / add-to-validation-cache

### Configuration-Rules
> Take a look into `schema_definitions` to get more into it
1. Use the raw-config as base for further processes defined in :schemas
2. Use `:wl OR :bl` - not both
3. `:raw` features
   - Renaming by `:rename`
   - Add additional columns by `:_additional`
   - Add multiple db-table configurations
3. `:schemas` features
   - :bl / :wl
   - :alias - Used to declare further information for debugging
   - :key-types - Define all keys as <optional/required==nothing>
   - :value-types - Define all values as <maybe/required==nothing>
   - :types - To make a mixed definition
   - :either-condition - Value should be either A or B

### Configuration-Examples
#### Given: Db-table named `workflows` with attributes
  - id
  - name
  - creator_id
  - is_active
  - configuration
  - created_at
  - updated_at

#### Example 1
> Creates a scheme of db-table `workflows` with all attributes and cache it as `:workflows-schema-raw`    
> Finally schema can already be fetched by `(get-schema :workflows-schema-raw)`
```clojure 
(def create-workflows-schema [{:raw [{:workflows {}}],
                               :raw-schema-name :workflows-schema-raw
                               }])
```

#### Example 2
> Creates a scheme of db-table `workflows` with except `created_at & updated_at` attributes and cache it by defined schemas.key   
```clojure 
(def create-workflows-schema [{:raw [{:workflows {:bl ["created_at" "updated_at"]}}],
                               :raw-schema-name :workflows-schema-raw
                               
                               :schemas [{:workflows.schema_create_workflow {:alias "mar.workflow/schema_create_workflow"
                                                                             :key-types "optional"
                                                                             :types [{:name {:key-type TYPE_NOTHING}}]
                                                                             :wl [:name :is_active :configuration]}}

                                         {:workflows.schema_update_workflow {:alias "mar.workflow/schema_update_workflow"
                                                                             :key-types "optional"
                                                                             :wl [:name :is_active :configuration]}}

                                         {:workflows.schema_export_workflow {:alias "mar.workflow/schema_export_workflow"
                                                                             :key-types "optional"
                                                                             :types [{:id {:key-type TYPE_NOTHING}}]
                                                                             :wl [:name :is_active :configuration :creator_id :created_at :updated_at]}}]}])
```
